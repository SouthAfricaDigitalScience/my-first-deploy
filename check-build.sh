# If you have gotten this far, congratulations ! the first test has passed - compilation
# Now you have to check whether the application has been _properly_ compiled and whether it can execute
# properly.
# Most Open Source projects provide built-in tests which you can run using the makefile, but it's also a
# good idea to try to execute the program itself with a trivial use case.

# you need the CI module to set up your environment.
. /etc/profile.d/modules.sh
module add ci

# we need to run make check in the build directory - it's still there from the previous step, since we're in the same job.
cd ${WORKSPACE}/${NAME}-${VERSION}/build-${BUILD_NUMBER}

# If this has passed, you can install the package
make install

# this should put things in $SOFT_DIR, which you recall is relative to /apprepo
